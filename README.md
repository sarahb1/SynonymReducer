SynonymReducer
==============

This program uses the Idilia APIs to reduce words to their core canonical synonyms. This contains two files: 1) the contents of the JAR file (made up of DisambiguateMpxml.class, org library, com.sun.mail library, edu.smu.tspell.wordnet library, and javax library.  2) The .bat batch file which outputs the results to a .csv file. Put your compiled JAR file and batch file in the same directory as your macro enabled excel file. **Note: Secret Key has been removed, obtain your own secret key by signing up at idilia.com)
